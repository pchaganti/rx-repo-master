> **📢 Important Notice**: The complete source code will be open-sourced after paper publication. Currently, we provide project demonstrations and partial code examples.

## 🎯 Quick Demo

Imagine describing a task in natural language, and RepoMaster automatically handles the rest: from finding the most suitable GitHub repository and understanding its complex code structure, to finally executing and completing the task! RepoMaster can handle everything from simple data extraction to complex AI model applications.

**For example, you could tell RepoMaster:**

-   **Simple Tasks**:
    -   "Help me scrape all product names and prices from this webpage."
    -   "Extract all table data from this PDF document and save it as a CSV file."
-   **Complex Tasks**:
    -   "Transform this portrait photo into the style of a Van Gogh oil painting." (As demonstrated below)
    -   "Automatically edit this long video, extract all exciting clips featuring a specific person, and add background music."
    -   "Process this meeting recording, separate different speakers' voices, generate meeting minutes, and extract key action items."

## 🚀 Overview

RepoMaster is a revolutionary autonomous agent framework specifically designed to explore, understand, and utilize GitHub repositories for solving complex real-world tasks. Unlike traditional approaches that generate code from scratch, RepoMaster treats open-source repositories on GitHub as composable tool modules, automatically leveraging these resources through intelligent search, hierarchical analysis, and autonomous exploration.

### 🎨 Illustration of RepoMaster Framework

<img src="example/overview.png" alt="RepoMaster 框架示意图" style="width: 600px; padding: 20px; background-color: #ffffff; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />

### 🎯 Core Philosophy

- **Repositories as Tools**: Treat open-source repositories as pre-built toolkits for solving complex tasks
- **Human-like Exploration**: Mimic how human programmers explore unfamiliar codebases
- **Smart Compression**: Efficiently manage massive code information within limited LLM context windows
- **Autonomous Execution**: End-to-end completion from task understanding to code execution


## 📊 Performance Results

### GitTaskBench Evaluation

| Framework | LLM | Execution Completion Rate | Task Pass Rate | Token Usage |
|-----------|-----|---------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| SWE-Agent | Claude 3.5 | 44.44% | 14.81% | 330k |
| OpenHands | Claude 3.5 | 48.15% | 24.07% | 3094k |
| **RepoMaster** | **Claude 3.5** | **75.92%** | **62.96%** | **154k** |

### MLE-Bench Evaluation

Note: MLE-Bench-R consists of 22 Kaggle competition tasks, all drawn from MLE-Bench and nearly identical to those in MLE-Bench-Lite. Unlike the original MLE-Bench, however, tasks in MLE-Bench-R require you to find GitHub repositories that can solve each problem and to understand and leverage their code—rather than writing entirely new solutions from scratch—to complete and submit your results.

| Framework | LLM | Valid Submission Rate | Medal Rate | Gold Medal Rate |
|-----------|-----|----------------------|------------|-----------------|
| SWE-Agent | Claude 3.5 | 50.00% | 4.55% | 4.55% |
| OpenHands | Claude 3.5 | 45.45% | 4.55% | 4.55% |
| **RepoMaster** | **Claude 3.5** | **95.45%** | **27.27%** | **22.73%** |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation Requirements

```bash
# Python 3.11+
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🎯 Single-Prompt Driven Automated Task Solving

The core appeal of RepoMaster lies in its powerful autonomy. You simply provide a task described in natural language, and `RepoMasterAgent` initiates its complex internal workflow to handle everything that follows. This is not just about executing a predefined script; it's a dynamic, intelligent process of exploration and problem-solving.

**When you execute `repo_master.solve_task_with_repo(task)`, RepoMaster might perform the following operations behind the scenes:**

1.  **Task Understanding & Intelligent Search**:
    *   Parses your natural language task (e.g., "Transform this image into Van Gogh style").
    *   Automatically searches for the most relevant open-source projects on platforms like GitHub.
    *   Evaluates and filters to select the most suitable code repository as a basis for solving the problem.

2.  **In-depth Code Comprehension & Planning**:
    *   Clones the selected repository and performs a hierarchical structural analysis (reading README, parsing code structure, identifying core modules, functions, etc.).
    *   Develops a detailed, multi-step execution plan based on task requirements and repository characteristics.

3.  **Autonomous Execution & Dynamic Adaptation**:
    *   **Environment Preparation**: Automatically handles dependency installation, data path configuration, etc.
    *   **Code Execution**: Runs key scripts identified from the repository or generates new glue code.
    *   **Intelligent Trial-and-Error & Debugging**:
        *   Monitors the execution process, capturing errors and warnings (e.g., `NameError`, `FileNotFoundError`, numerical instability like `NaN` loss).
        *   Autonomously diagnoses the cause of issues based on error messages (e.g., missing imports, improper parameters, incorrect file paths).
        *   Dynamically adjusts the execution strategy (e.g., modifying scripts, adjusting hyperparameters, changing optimizers, searching for correct filenames).
    *   **Iterative Optimization**: Multiple attempts until the task is successfully executed or a preset attempt limit is reached.

4.  **Result Consolidation & Delivery**:
    *   Collects execution results and saves them to the specified location or format.
    *   Reports task completion status and final output to the user.

**Basic Usage Example (Neural Style Transfer):**

```python
from core.agent_scheduler import RepoMasterAgent

# Initialize RepoMaster
llm_config = {
    "config_list": [{
        "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        # "api_key": "your_api_key", # Please replace with your API Key
        # "base_url": "https://api.anthropic.com" # Please replace with your API Endpoint
    }],
    "timeout": 2000,
    "temperature": 0.1,
}

code_execution_config = {
    "work_dir": "workspace", 
    "use_docker": False
}

repo_master = RepoMasterAgent(
    llm_config=llm_config,
    code_execution_config=code_execution_config,
)

# Define a complex AI task
task = """
I need to transfer the style of an artwork to a content image.
Content image path: 'example/origin.jpg'
Style reference image path: 'example/style.jpg'
Please save the final stylized image as 'workspace/merged_styled_image.png'
"""

# User initiates the task with a single line of code
# RepoMaster will autonomously handle the entire process of search, understanding, execution, and debugging
result_summary = repo_master.solve_task_with_repo(task)

print("Task Completion Summary:")
print(result_summary)
```

The `task` string in the code above is the core of your interaction with RepoMaster. RepoMaster will parse this natural language task and, like an experienced developer, autonomously find resources, write or adjust code, handle issues encountered during the process, and finally deliver the results.

### Advanced Usage

#### 1. Using Specific Repository

```python
from core.git_task import TaskManager, AgentRunner

# Construct task configuration
task_info = {
    "repo": {
        "type": "github",
        "url": "https://github.com/spatie/pdf-to-text",
    },
    "task_description": "Extract PDF text content",
    "input_data": [
        {
            "path": "/path/to/input.pdf",
            "description": "PDF file to process"
        }
    ],
}

# Execute task
result = AgentRunner.run_agent(task_info)
```

#### 2. Local Repository Analysis

```python
from core.git_agent import CodeExplorer

# Initialize code explorer
explorer = CodeExplorer(
    local_repo_path="/path/to/local/repo",
    work_dir="workspace",
    task_type="general",
    use_venv=True,
    llm_config=llm_config
